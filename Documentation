ML models were developed using Python 3.12.4 with their respective libraries: 
PyTorch for the neural network model, scikit-learn for random forest, and xgboost for the XGboost model. 
Data preprocessing was performed using the pandas library while performance metrics and visualizations were generated using scikit-learn and matplotlib. 
The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library was used to evaluate feature importance and generate plots illustrating each featureâ€™s impact on model predictions.

Tabular Data was contained within Excel spreadsheets. 
Binary variables were dichotomized into (0,1): E.g. RT Boost (Yes = 1, No = 0), Diabetes (Yes = 1, No = 0)
Continous variables were normalized between 0 and 1. (X_max = X.max(axis=0), X = X / X_max)
Age was measured as date of birth to date of cancer surgery.

Due to patient privacy reasons, the dataset is not openly available. 
Data utilized can be made available, interoperable, and reusable for other applications upon reasonable request to corresponding author.
